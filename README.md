The “Count-to-Ten” game—or as we refer to it, the Lydia Diamond Game—is an icebreaker game popular
among team-building exercises. Given n players and a time limit t, the goal of the game is for the players
to collectively count as high as possible without explicitly colluding or strategizing. However, if at least
two players announce a number at the same time, the game ends at the last number which was last
successfully counted.

Different variations of the Lydia Diamond game have been played, with some incorporating rules
regarding eye contact or time limits. Yet, American Playwright Lydia Diamond claims that after playing the
game at the beginning and end of every theater rehearsal, her group was able to learn to consistently
count to 10 as a collective. While such a claim of mastering this game is impressive, the in-person counting
game may be prone to collusion because players may be able to distinguish each other by their voice and
location.

However, if we kept practicing the Lydia Diamond game while only being informed track of how high group
counts, is it possible for a group of players to collectively master the Lydia Diamond game? This stochastic setting shares applications in self-organizing carrier protocols exployed by wired and ethernet channels, as designing stronger collision avoidance protocls resolves bottlenecks in the fields of data transmission and reception.
We explore crude machine learning and control theory approaches to build interpretability towards how multi-agent systems strategize in the  face of stochastic environments.

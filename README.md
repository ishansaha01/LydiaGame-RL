# LydiaGame-RL
The "Count-to-Ten" game, also known as the Lydia Diamond Game, is a team-building ice-breaker that challenges multi-agent systems to master global policies in stochastic environments. We explore basic machine learning and control theory approaches to understand how these systems strategize in such conditions.
